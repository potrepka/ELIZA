# Voiceflow Interview API Project 💬

Welcome to Voiceflow's API Project!

Congrats on making it to this part of the interview process. 🥳 

The goal of this project is to create a local Node.js server that interfaces a Voiceflow project with another service.

It’ll help you gain a much better understanding of how conversational interfaces work and how Voiceflow plugs into that flow.  

## Setup 📦
Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) on your computer.

Fork this repository.

> to install all dependencies (node_modules) :

```
yarn install
```

> to start the server on http://localhost:4000 :

```
yarn start
```

_if your http://localhost automatically resolves to https://localhost - try on incognito mode or a different browser_

Go on http://localhost:4000, you should see a chat window like this:

If you try typing something, it will always respond back with "hello world!" and "goodbye". This is because the backend hasn't been fully implemented.

# Overview ℹ️
Login/sign up for [Voiceflow Creator](https://creator.voiceflow.com), and build a simple **Custom Assistant** project. If you need inspiration you can check out the [Templates Workspace](https://creator.voiceflow.com/workspace/D8nag5Vko2).

In your `app.ts` we can see that there is a `app.post('/message', (req, res) => ...)` Express endpoint. This is what needs to be completed.

Read the Voiceflow Dialog Management **Stateless API** documentation:

https://raw.githack.com/voiceflow/general-runtime/master/backend/docs/index.html

> ⚠️  make sure to use the **Stateless API** - *do not use the State API*

Use the Voiceflow API to hook up your Voiceflow Project to the `POST /message` endpoint.

Whenever you send something on the frontend you will notice that it logs the `req.body` - containing a `message: string` and `userID: string`. The `userID` is unique per tab. If you open a new tab to http://localhost:4000 you will get a different `userID`. This emulates different people from all over the world using this chat service.

**Ensure that distinct users have distinct conversations**


## Alternative Option 👑
Here we are using an HTML/CSS/Jquery frontend to display the conversation. Instead you can pick any conversational platform where people can converse back and forth with a bot, such as - [discord](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/02/building-discord-bot-discordjs/), [slack](https://github.com/slackapi/bolt-js), [messenger](https://www.hebergementwebs.com/programming/how-to-create-a-facebook-bot-app-using-node-js), etc.

You can use this platform as your frontend instead, and set up your backend to interface your Voiceflow project with this platform. Ensure that this platform has an API or SDK that allows a Node.js server to receive a webhook request, and reply back. 

If you choose this option, there's no need to fork this repo, you can start off with a template repo for the platform you picked.

There is usually some additional setup involved with these platforms. If you are looking for something easy and quick to set up, try [telegram](https://core.telegram.org/bots) *(you need to install the app and message the "Botfather")*

These platforms will always send a unique userID/sessionID per request.

**Ensure that distinct users have distinct conversations**

> there's no brownie points for doing this alternative option instead of the standard. It is useful if you've created a bot with the platform before - and it's also more practical than a mock html chat.

# Tips 📝
Unless you get fancy and go off the rails (which isn't a bad thing 👍) this project takes around ~1-2 hours if you are familiar with the stack. Keep in mind this isn't a race to get it done - it's about getting it done well.
* use Typescript proficiently
* use repeatable, scalable patterns
* make your backend structure go beyond just `app.ts`
* account for edge cases
* manage sensitive data securely
* manage different user session states well
